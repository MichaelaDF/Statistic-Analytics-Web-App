These tests were divided into 4 categories: 
	T1 - User login/logout functionality
	T2 - Additional $_SESSION functionality
	T3 - MySQL database functionality
	T4 - Google Charts functionality

For each category unit tests were developed to attempt to identify any flaws in functionality or holes within the coding logic and ensure that any errors encountered were properly handled.
For testing purposes, each of the unit tests were manually conducted to ensure intended functionality of the web application.
